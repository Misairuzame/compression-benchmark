# Compression Algorithm Benchmark
Simple Shell script to benchmark different compression algorithms.

Just clone the repository or download the script, configure a couple of options at the top of the file, then run it.

The script will create a temporary folder to place temporary archives in, which will be deleted on exit.

The results will be written on a .csv file (filename configurable), and a summary will be printed when the tests end.
